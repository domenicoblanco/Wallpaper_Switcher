# Wallpaper Switcher
Just a simple Android app to change your wallpaper automagically âœ¨

## How does it work?
Just set your preferred wallpaper for each theme and when your device will switch to light or dark theme, your wallpaper will follow your preferred scheme!

## Will it drain my battery?
Nope, it uses a background service (as matter of fact it will keep a notification) that will receive a message from the operating system in order to switch your wallpaper.

## I hate that notification, can I disable it?
Android requires a notification for each service, in order to inform users that something is running under the hood... But, maybe you could try disabling notifications for this app from the Settings app.

## I'd like to contribute
This is awesome! The code is available here for everyone, feel free to send a PR and optimize this app c:
